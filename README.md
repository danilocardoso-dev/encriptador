🔐 Encriptor — Simple Encryption and Decryption

🚀 Description
Encriptor is a simple Python tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom substitution algorithm. The project was created to practice information security concepts and reverse engineering techniques, while demonstrating programming and cybersecurity skills.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Main programming language.

Simple Substitution Algorithm: Basic encryption technique.

Git: Source code version control.

⚙️ How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/danilocardoso-dev/encriptador.git
cd encriptador
Run the encryption script:

bash
Copiar
Editar
python encrypter.py
To decrypt, run:

bash
Copiar
Editar
python decrypter.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to input your message.

📸 Usage Example

🧪 How It Works
Encriptor uses a simple substitution algorithm where specific characters are replaced by predefined sequences. For example:

a → ai

e → enter

i → imes

o → ober

u → ufat

This creates a basic level of encryption ideal for educational purposes and understanding the fundamentals of information security.

🔐 Pentesting Context
While simple, this project serves as a foundation for:

Encryption Algorithm Analysis: Studying basic encryption techniques.

Reverse Engineering: Understanding how algorithms can be broken or modified.

Security Tool Development: Creating scripts for security testing.
